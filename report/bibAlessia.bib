              We systematically reviewed observational and clinical trials (baseline) studies examining differences in gait parameters between Parkinson’s disease (PD) in on-medication state and healthy control. Four electronic databases were searched (November-2018 and updated in October-2020). Independent researchers identified studies that evaluated gait parameters measured quantitatively during self-selected walking speed. Risk of bias was assessed using an instrument proposed by Downs and Black (1998). Pooled effects were reported as standardized mean differences and 95\% confidence intervals using a random-effects model. A total of 72 studies involving 3027 participants (1510 with PD and 1517 health control) met the inclusion criteria. The self-selected walking speed, stride length, swing time and hip excursion were reduced in people with PD compared with healthy control. Additionally, PD subjects presented higher cadence and double support time. Although with a smaller difference for treadmill, walking speed is reduced both on treadmill (.13 m s
              −1
              ) and on overground (.17 m s
              −1
              ) in PD. The self-select walking speed, stride length, cadence, double support, swing time and sagittal hip angle were altered in people with PD compared with healthy control. The precise determination of these modifications will be beneficial in determining which intervention elements are most critical in bringing about positive, clinically meaningful changes in individuals with PD (PROSPERO protocol CRD42018113042).},

	abstract = {Backward walking (BW) is being increasingly used in neurologic and orthopedic rehabilitation as well as in sports to promote balance control as it provides a unique challenge to the sensorimotor control system. The identiﬁcation of initial foot contact (IC) and terminal foot contact (TC) events is crucial for gait analysis. Data of optical motion capture (OMC) kinematics and inertial motion units (IMUs) are commonly used to detect gait events during forward walking (FW). However, the agreement between such methods during BW has not been investigated. In this study, the OMC kinematics and inertial data of 10 healthy young adults were recorded during BW and FW on a treadmill at diﬀerent speeds. Gait events were measured using both kinematics and inertial data and then evaluated for agreement. Excellent reliability (Interclass Correlation {\textgreater} 0.9) was achieved for the identiﬁcation of both IC and TC. The absolute diﬀerences between methods during BW were 18.5 ± 18.3 and 20.4 ± 15.2 ms for IC and TC, respectively, compared to 9.1 ± 9.6 and 10.0 ± 14.9 for IC and TC, respectively, during FW. The high levels of agreement between methods indicate that both may be used for some applications of BW gait analysis.},

Nevertheless, only few studies addressed the assessment of the actual performance of these algorithms, rather considering each proposed algorithm as a whole.},

	abstract = {Analysis of human movement provides systematic and quantitative information of movement. The detection of events that occur during walking allows for the calculation of spatiotemporal parameters, commonly used for the characterization of gait. A method for visual detection of gait events was previously evaluated, showing promising results. The method should now be used in the clinical setting for estimation of gait parameters and symmetry. The aims of this study were then to compare the performance of the visual method in a clinical setting against its performance in a gait laboratory and to evaluate its behavior for calculation of gait symmetry in eight healthy subjects. Two gait events were detected and six temporal parameters (TP) were calculated. Also, a symmetry index (SI) was calculated for three TP. Results for the calculation of TP in the clinical setting were comparable to those obtained in the gait laboratory. Also, the values of TP and symmetry were within the range of those reported by other authors. These results suggest that the visual events detection method can be considered as an option for basic Analysis of Human Movement in the clinical environment.},

Another goal of this paper was to explore how significantly a small proportion of outliers can affect even simple analyses.  The examples show a strong beneficial effect of removal of extreme scores.  Accuracy tended to increase significantly and substantially, and errors of inference tended to drop significantly and substantially once extreme scores were removed},
