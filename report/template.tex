	\begin{abstract}
		\noindent With the current ageing population, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease, an age-related disorder, is significantly increasing. More research is required to deepen our understanding of this disease with the goal of developing new diagnostic methods, monitoring disease progression and uncovering new potential treatments. Gait analysis has been previously suggested as an effective tool for studying Parkinson's disease. There are many modalities that can be used to examine gait; however, accelerometers present themselves as a leading candidate in clinical applications, given their lower cost and ability for continuous tracking outside of a laboratory setting. In a first part, this study validates the use of accelerometers to count steps by comparing measured data with an actual known amount of steps. Subsequently, several temporal gait parameters from healthy participants and a Parkinson's disease patient were calculated using accelerometer data and shown to differ.
