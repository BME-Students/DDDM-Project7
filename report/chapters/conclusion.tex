\section{Conclusion}
In summary, while this study demonstrates the potential trade-offs associated with subsampling, addressing the identified limitations and pursuing the outlined future directions could significantly enhance the applicability and reliability of subsampling techniques in blood glucose monitoring. These efforts will be essential to ensure that CGM systems continue to provide high-quality data while meeting the practical constraints of real-world applications.
