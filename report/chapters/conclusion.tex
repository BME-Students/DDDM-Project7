\section{Conclusion}

%In summary, while this study demonstrates the potential trade-offs associated with subsampling, addressing the identified limitations and pursuing the outlined future directions could significantly enhance the applicability and reliability of subsampling techniques in blood glucose monitoring. These efforts will be essential to ensure that CGM systems continue to provide high-quality data while meeting the practical constraints of real-world applications.
 
 This study artificially generated sparse glucose measurement data by subsampling, at different rates, continuous glucose monitoring data obtained from patients with T1D. This study investigated whether simple interpolation techniques, such as cubic spline and polynomial of degree five, were capable of reliably reconstructing and approximating the original signal. While achievable at an interval of 40 minutes, this timeframe is still too short to allow fingerstick sample data to compare to that of continuous glucose monitoring.
