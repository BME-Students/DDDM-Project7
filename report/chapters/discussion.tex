\section{Discussion}

Overall, up until a subsampling rate of 8, the reconstructed signal and associated metrics remain relatively coherent with the ground truth. However, as the subsampling rate is increased above 8, the reconstructed signal and associated metrics substantially degrade.

A subsampling rate of 8 corresponds to glucose measurement intervals of 40 minutes. Therefore, from the observations of this study, it would be possible to obtain similar profiles to CGM data from fingerstick samples collected every 40 minutes. Daily, assuming a 16 hour awake period and an 8 hour sleep, this would then entail obtaining 24 fingerstick samples.

While this is not too absurd of a number, it still remains rather large and can definitely be considered inconvenient and unsustainable for patients. Additionally, this would then also require almost 9 thousand test strips a year, for which one can imagine the cost to still be substantial. Therefore, the results from this study, unfortunately, do not yield a satisfactory enough method to give disadvantaged patients the possibility to reap the benefits of continuous blood glucose monitoring.

Within the context of this study, dynamic and adaptive subsampling could present an additional avenue to explore. The idea would be to obtain fingerstick samples at a higher frequency when in proximity to a major glucose level changing event, such as a meal intake, and at smaller frequencies otherwise. 

Further opportunities could lie in the fact that since so many factors such as time of day, meal intake and amount of physical activity, heavily influence glucose levels, these could all be taken into account when reconstructing, or predicting, blood glucose patterns  \cite{noauthor_42_2018}. These could be measured using non-invasive wearable devices and thereby supplement the few fingerstick samples that the patient still collects. Incorporating this data would then require straying away from simple interpolation techniques and explore more advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning models.
