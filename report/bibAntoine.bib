	abstract = {Objective: Diabetes mellitus is an important chronic disease that is prevalent around the world. Different countries and diverse cultures use varying approaches to dealing with this chronic condition. Also, with the advancement of computation and automated decision-making, many tools and technologies are now available to patients suffering from this disease. In this work, the investigators attempt to analyze approaches taken towards managing this illness in India and the United States.
Methods: In this work, the investigators have used available literature and data to compare the use of artiﬁcial intelligence in diabetes management. Findings: The article provides key insights to comparison of diabetes management in terms of the nature of the healthcare system, availability, electronic health records, cultural factors, data privacy, affordability, and other important variables. Interestingly, variables such as quality of electronic health records, and cultural factors are key impediments in implementing an efﬁciencydriven management system for dealing with this chronic disease.
Conclusion: The article adds to the body of knowledge associated with the management of this disease, establishing a critical need for using artiﬁcial intelligence in diabetes care management.},

	abstract = {Background: Predictions based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data are the basis for automatic suspension and resumption of insulin delivery by a predictive low-glucose management feature termed ‘‘suspend before low,’’ which is part of the Medtronic MiniMedÒ 640G combined insulin pump and CGM system. This study assessed the safety and performance characteristics of the system in an in-clinic setting at eight sites. Materials and Methods: In-clinic standardized increases in basal insulin delivery rates were used to induce nocturnal hypoglycemia in subjects (14–75 years) with type 1 diabetes wearing the MiniMed 640G system. The ‘‘suspend before low’’ feature was set at 65 mg/dL, and as a result, the predictive algorithm suspended insulin delivery when the forecasted glucose was predicted to be £85 mg/dL in 30 min (a 20 mg/dL safety buffer). Reference plasma glucose values (Yellow Springs Instruments [YSI], Yellow Springs, OH) were used to establish hypoglycemia and were deﬁned as ‡2 consecutive values £65 mg/dL.
Results: Eighty subjects were screened. Among the 69 successful completers, 27 experienced a hypoglycemic event and 42 did not, a prevention rate of 60\%. The mean (–standard deviation) YSI value at the time of pump suspension was 101 – 18.5 mg/dL, and the mean duration of the 68 ‘‘suspend before low’’ events was 105 – 27 min. At 120 min after the start of the pump suspension events, the mean YSI value was 102 – 34.6 mg/dL.
Conclusion: The MiniMed 640G ‘‘suspend before low’’ feature prevented 60\% of induced predicted hypoglycemic events without signiﬁcant rebound hyperglycemia.},

	abstract = {Background: The occurrences of acute complications arising from hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia peak as young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) take control of their own care. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices provide real-time glucose readings enabling users to manage their control proactively. Machine learning algorithms can use CGM data to make ahead-of-time risk predictions and provide insight into an individual’s longer term control.
Methods: We introduce explainable machine learning to make predictions of hypoglycemia ({\textless}70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia ({\textgreater}270 mg/dL) up to 60 minutes ahead of time. We train our models using CGM data from 153 people living with T1D in the CITY (CGM Intervention in Teens and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes)survey totaling more than 28 000 days of usage, which we summarize into (short-term, medium-term, and long-term) glucose control features along with demographic information. We use machine learning explanations (SHAP [SHapley Additive exPlanations]) to identify which features have been most important in predicting risk per user.
Results: Machine learning models (XGBoost) show excellent performance at predicting hypoglycemia (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC]: 0.998, average precision: 0.953) and hyperglycemia (AUROC: 0.989, average precision: 0.931) in comparison with a baseline heuristic and logistic regression model.
Conclusions: Maximizing model performance for glucose risk prediction and management is crucial to reduce the burden of alarm fatigue on CGM users. Machine learning enables more precise and timely predictions in comparison with baseline models. SHAP helps identify what about a CGM user’s glucose control has led to predictions of risk which can be used to reduce their long-term risk of complications.},

	abstract = {Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that causes abnormal blood glucose (BG) regulation that might result in short and long-term health complications and even death if not properly managed. Currently, there is no cure for diabetes. However, self-management of the disease, especially keeping BG in the recommended range, is central to the treatment. This includes actively tracking BG levels and managing physical activity, diet, and insulin intake. The recent advancements in diabetes technologies and self-management applications have made it easier for patients to have more access to relevant data. In this regard, the development of an artificial pancreas (a closed-loop system), personalized decision systems, and BG event alarms are becoming more apparent than ever. Techniques such as predicting BG (modeling of a personalized profile), and modeling BG dynamics are central to the development of these diabetes management technologies. The increased availability of sufficient patient historical data has paved the way for the introduction of machine learning and its application for intelligent and improved systems for diabetes management. The capability of machine learning to solve complex tasks with dynamic environment and knowledge has contributed to its success in diabetes research.},

The proposed system is based on the combination of Compartmental Models (CMs) and artificial Neural Networks (NNs). This model aims at the development of an accurate system, in order to assist Type 1 diabetes patients to handle their blood glucose profile and recognize dangerous metabolic states. Data from a Type 1 diabetes patient, stored in a database, have been used as input to the hybrid system. The data contain information about measured blood glucose levels, insulin intake, and description of food intake, along with the corresponding time. The data are passed to three separate CMs, which produce estimations about (i) the effect of Short Acting (SA) insulin intake on blood insulin concentration, (ii) the effect of Intermediate Acting (IA) insulin intake on blood insulin concentration, and (iii) the effect of carbohydrate intake on blood glucose absorption from the gut. The outputs of the three CMs are passed to a Recurrent NN (RNN) in order to predict subsequent blood glucose levels. The RNN is trained with the Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm. The resulted blood glucose predictions are promising for the use of the proposed model for blood glucose level estimation for Type 1 diabetes patients.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews and critically appraises the application of compartmental models for generating glycaemic predictions and offering clinical decision support in diabetes care. Comparisons are made with alternative algorithmic-based approaches. Unresolved issues raised for model-based techniques include the relative lack of input data necessary for generating reasonable blood glucose predictions, and the high level of uncertainty associated with such predictions which limits their use as guides for therapeutic insulin-dosage adjustments. It is concluded that compartmental model-based approaches, while not offering much beneﬁt for clinical/therapeutic application, will have a role to play as research tools and for educational use. By contrast it is proposed that algorithmic-based approaches, especially in conjunction with telemedicine and Internet applications, are likely to see growing use for day-to-day therapeutic decision support. Randomised controlled clinical trials however will be required, together with other evaluation efforts, before algorithmic-based approaches — like any other clinical technique — can be widely adopted into routine medical practice. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Accurate prediction of blood glucose variations in type 2 diabetes (T2D) will facilitate better glycemic control and decrease the occurrence of hypoglycemic episodes as well as the morbidity and mortality associated with T2D, hence increasing the quality of life of patients. Owing to the complexity of the blood glucose dynamics, it is difficult to design accurate predictive models in every circumstance, i.e., hypo/normo/hyperglycemic events. We developed deep-learning methods to predict patient-specific blood glucose during various time horizons in the immediate future using patient-specific every 30-min long glucose measurements by the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to predict future glucose levels in 5 min to 1 h. In general, the major challenges to address are (1) the dataset of each patient is often too small to train a patient-specific deep-learning model, and (2) the dataset is usually highly imbalanced given that hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes are usually much less common than normoglycemia. We tackle these two challenges using transfer learning and data augmentation, respectively. We systematically examined three neural network architectures, different loss functions, four transfer-learning strategies, and four data augmentation techniques, including mixup and generative models. Taken together, utilizing these methodologies we achieved over 95\% prediction accuracy and 90\% sensitivity for a time period within the clinically useful 1 h prediction horizon that would allow a patient to react and correct either hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia. We have also demonstrated that the same network architecture and transfer-learning methods perform well for the type 1 diabetes OhioT1DM public dataset.},
