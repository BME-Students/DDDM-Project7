	abstract = {Human gait is a complex phenomenon that involves intricate interactions between the pelvis, hips, knees, and ankles. The goal of normal human ambulation is to facilitate travel from one location to another while minimizing effort and maintaining adequate stability across a wide variety of walking conditions. This is made possible by complex interactions between central and peripheral neural pathways coordinating movement of the musculoskeletal system. Understanding human gait requires a solid knowledge of underlying physiology and biomechanical principles. Observational gait analysis skills are essential in the evaluation and management of gait deviations seen in individuals with disabling conditions. Comprehending the relationship between clinical examination findings, biomechanical influences, and gait pattern observations serves as the foundation for the appropriate prescription and fitting of lower limb orthoses.},

              We systematically reviewed observational and clinical trials (baseline) studies examining differences in gait parameters between Parkinson’s disease (PD) in on-medication state and healthy control. Four electronic databases were searched (November-2018 and updated in October-2020). Independent researchers identified studies that evaluated gait parameters measured quantitatively during self-selected walking speed. Risk of bias was assessed using an instrument proposed by Downs and Black (1998). Pooled effects were reported as standardized mean differences and 95\% confidence intervals using a random-effects model. A total of 72 studies involving 3027 participants (1510 with PD and 1517 health control) met the inclusion criteria. The self-selected walking speed, stride length, swing time and hip excursion were reduced in people with PD compared with healthy control. Additionally, PD subjects presented higher cadence and double support time. Although with a smaller difference for treadmill, walking speed is reduced both on treadmill (.13 m s
              −1
              ) and on overground (.17 m s
              −1
              ) in PD. The self-select walking speed, stride length, cadence, double support, swing time and sagittal hip angle were altered in people with PD compared with healthy control. The precise determination of these modifications will be beneficial in determining which intervention elements are most critical in bringing about positive, clinically meaningful changes in individuals with PD (PROSPERO protocol CRD42018113042).},

We present material at the cutting edge of neuroscience in a way that is accessible to both science and nonscience students alike. The level of the material is comparable to an introductory college text in general biology. The book is divided into four parts: Part I, Foundations; Part II, Sensory and Motor Systems; Part III, The Brain and Behavior; and Part IV, The Changing Brain. We begin Part I by introducing the modern field of neuroscience and tracing some of its historical antecedents. Then we take a close look at the structure and function of individual neurons, how they communicate chemically, and how these building blocks are arranged to form a nervous system. In Part II, we go inside the brain to examine the structure and function of the systems that serve the senses and command voluntary movements. In Part III, we explore the neurobiology of human behavior, including motivation, sex, emotion, sleep, language, attention, and mental illness. Finally, in Part IV, we look at how the environment modifies the brain, both during development and in adult learning and memory"--Provided by publisher},

Progress in new technologies has led the development of a series of devices and techniques which allow for objective evaluation, making measurements more efficient and effective and providing specialists with reliable information. Firstly, an introduction of the key gait parameters and semi-subjective methods is presented. Secondly, technologies and studies on the different objective methods are reviewed. Finally, based on the latest research, the characteristics of each method are discussed. 40\% of the reviewed articles published in late 2012 and 2013 were related to non-wearable systems, 37.5\% presented inertial sensor-based systems, and the remaining 22.5\% corresponded to other wearable systems. An increasing number of research works demonstrate that various parameters such as precision, conformability, usability or transportability have indicated that the portable systems based on body sensors are promising methods for gait analysis.},

	abstract = {An original signal processing algorithm is presented to automatically extract, on a stride-by-stride basis, four consecutive fundamental events of walking, heel strike (HS), toe strike (TS), heel-off (HO), and toe-off (TO), from wireless accelerometers applied to the right and left foot. First, the signals recorded from heel and toe three-axis accelerometers are segmented providing heel and toe ﬂat phases. Then, the four gait events are deﬁned from these ﬂat phases. The accelerometer-based event identiﬁcation was validated in seven healthy volunteers and a total of 247 trials against reference data provided by a force plate, a kinematic 3D analysis system, and video camera. HS, TS, HO, and TO were detected with a temporal accuracy ± precision of 1.3 ms ± 7.2 ms, −4.2 ms ± 10.9 ms, −3.7 ms ± 14.5 ms, and −1.8 ms ± 11.8 ms, respectively, with the associated 95\% conﬁdence intervals ranging from −6.3 ms to 2.2 ms. It is concluded that the developed accelerometer-based method can accurately and precisely detect HS, TS, HO, and TO, and could thus be used for the ambulatory monitoring of gait features computed from these events when measured concurrently in both feet.},
